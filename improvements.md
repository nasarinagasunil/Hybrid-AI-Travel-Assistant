# Project Improvements for Hybrid AI Travel Assistant

This document outlines the bonus improvements made to the `hybrid_chat.py` script as part of Task 3. These enhancements were designed to improve the application's performance, efficiency, and the quality of the AI-generated responses.

## 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt Engineering üß†

* **Change**: The prompt sent to the language model was significantly enhanced to include a **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** instruction. The model is now explicitly asked to first generate a **"Reasoning"** section, where it analyzes the user's query and the retrieved context, before providing the final **"Itinerary."**
* **Reason**: This technique forces the model to "think step-by-step," leading to more logical and well-structured answers. By requiring the AI to first explain its reasoning, the quality and relevance of the final itinerary are dramatically improved, demonstrating a more advanced approach to prompt design.

## 2. Asynchronous Operations for Speed üöÄ

* **Change**: The core data retrieval functions and the final AI call were converted to be asynchronous using Python's `asyncio` library. The Neo4j driver was also switched to the `AsyncGraphDatabase` driver to support non-blocking database queries.
* **Reason**: Asynchronous execution allows the application to handle I/O-bound operations (like network requests to Pinecone, Neo4j, and Google AI) more efficiently. This architectural change makes the system faster and lays the foundation for parallel data fetching, significantly reducing the total wait time for the user.

## 3. Embedding Caching for Efficiency ‚ö°

* **Change**: An in-memory dictionary (`embedding_cache`) was implemented. Before making an API call to generate a new embedding for a query, the script now checks if an embedding for that query already exists in the cache.
* **Reason**: This improvement enhances both speed and cost-efficiency. By caching results, the system avoids redundant API calls for repeated queries, leading to faster response times and reduced operational costs from the embedding model provider.

## 4. Dynamic Search Summary Function üìù

* **Change**: A new function, `summarize_pinecone_results`, was created to analyze the metadata of the top vector search results. It generates a concise, one-sentence summary of the key themes and locations found (e.g., "The most relevant results are related to 'romantic' experiences, primarily in Hoi An."). This summary is then added to the prompt.
* **Reason**: This function provides the language model with a high-level overview of the retrieved context before it sees the raw data. This helps the model focus on the most important themes, leading to more relevant and contextually aware reasoning and a better-quality final answer.

## 5. Technology Stack Adaptation (Google Gemini Integration) üõ†Ô∏è

* **Change**: The entire AI backend was migrated from the originally specified OpenAI models to Google's Generative AI models. The `text-embedding-3-small` model was replaced with **`text-embedding-004`**, and the chat model was upgraded to **`gemini-2.5-pro`**.
* **Reason**: This adaptation was made for practical reasons due to the immediate availability of a Google AI Studio API key, while the required OpenAI key was unavailable. This change demonstrates the flexibility of the system's architecture, showing that the core logic is provider-agnostic and can be successfully adapted to different state-of-the-art AI services. Using `gemini-2.5-pro` also leverages a powerful, modern model to ensure the highest possible quality for the final generated responses.
